For the backend portion of this assignment we used the cases.py, deaths.py, and vaccines.py to gather the information used in the
frontend from raw JSON files listed below:

Vaccines: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.json
Deaths:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/internal/megafile--deaths.json
Cases: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/internal/megafile--cases-tests.json

Overview of code:
Cases and deaths: These two basically work the same way where they take in the data from the JSON files, afterwards parse through these files
to give us the data for the last 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, and all time. As it is parsing through the code has a function to keep track
of the max and min used in the frontend to properly shade the countries accordingly. After this, these programs return the data that 
looks like the link below:

Vaccines: This program is a tad bit different than the others but still have the same core principles. This program is different because 
the original JSON file we were working with lacked data that corresponded with the others, so we had to use a different JSON that didnt 
have as much discrepancy. Due to the formatting and a lack of info for the set days, we adjusted the code to parse through that data however 
if the data we are looking for is not there for the points of comparison (today and 30 days ago, etc..) we would add a day and see if the data 
we need was there and keep repeating until we got a match. The same concept of max and min are present as well and provides the data in the format
given above.
